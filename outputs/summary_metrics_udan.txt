Problem statement: IIT Guwahati Winter Consulting — Case 1. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Total routes analyzed: 343
Routes loss-making (base): 343
Routes loss-making (post fuel shock +25%): 343
Routes that UDAN support (₹50000/month) can save (flip to non-loss): 0
Routes still loss-making even with UDAN: 343

Avg margin per flight (base): -131,456 INR
Avg margin per flight (post-shock): -149,420 INR
Avg margin per flight (with UDAN): -148,587 INR

Key assumptions:
 - Latest ATF used: 41.35 INR/L (derived from atf_time_series).
 - Seats/load factor: 78/0.72
 - Fixed cost per flight: ₹250000
 - UDAN monthly support assumed: ₹50000 (→ ₹833/flight at 60 flights/mo)

Recommendation (from analysis):
 - Use UDAN selectively to stabilize socially-important, high-volatility regional routes (Option B as buffer).
 - Primary action remains network optimization & selective pricing on core routes (Option A) — UDAN supports downside protection.
